# Django Views

## Overview
`apps/core/views.py` is the file containing the Django views for our app.

Django views are the functions in Django that render the webpages, as well as access and transform the data in the database.

## How to Use this Doc
Whenever a Django view is created or updated, the documentation for that view should be updated in this doc. 

## Current Views and Functions:

### Home
Renders `templates/home.html` at the default endpoint â€“ `""`

### Search
Search does two things:

1. Renders `templates/search.html` at the `/search/` endpoint.
2. Handles search requests from search form submissions. Queries the database, and then returns the `results` object.

#### The Results Object:
Search results returned by the database. 

This is an object containing the following fields, corresponding to the columns in the database's bills table:

`bill_id`: The unique identifier for the bill
`number`: The bill number
`title`: The bill title
`summary`: The bill summary
`status`: The bill status
`topics`: TO BE IMPLEMENTED
`favorite`: TO BE IMPLEMENTED
