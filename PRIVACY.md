# BILLinois Data & Privacy Policy

The goal of BILLinois is to enable everyone in Illinois to learn about and track legislation they care about. As such, we collect data from users to notify them when the status of their favorite bills change. At BILLinois, we take data privacy very seriously, and have outlined this Data & Privacy Policy to demonstrate how we protect user information.

## What User Data Do We Store?

We collect the following pieces of information from users: 

- Email
- Phone number
- Name

All of this information is stored in a protected, remote server accessible to BILLinois developers only. Your password is encrypted before it enters our databases, meaning we never have access to your login credential. 

All of this data is stored until you delete your account. Upon deletion, all of your information is deleted from our application and databases. 

## How Do We Use Your Data?

We use your email to notify you when your favorited bills have important updates (moved to committee, voted on, etc.). We have also built out functionality for notifications via phone number, which is pending vendor approval. We will never sell or forward your data to a 3rd party. We will also never ask for sensitive information (credit card information, social security numbers, etc.).
